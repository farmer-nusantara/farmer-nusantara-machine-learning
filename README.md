**Goals :**
<br />
For this stage, machine learning has built 3 kinds of image classification models, one model is representative of one food plant, there are Paddy, Corn, and Soy Bean. We use a public dataset from the Kaggle platform for that classification. Paddy has 10 classes, corn 4 classes, and 3 classes for soybean. Those 3 datasets include the health plant conditions class
<br />
